> A measurable governance operator on the receipt-bus σ-algebra of agentic AI — publishing Covenant Proof Standard run artifacts from real production executions with `mocked:false` evidence chains for external auditability.

---

## What this is

**szl-trust** is the public transparency layer of the SZL Holdings governed AI platform. It publishes Covenant Proof Standard (CPS) run artifacts — hash-chained, cryptographically verifiable governance receipts from real production executions. The canonical reference run is the E4 Codex Kernel (2026-04-29): 12 receipts, all `mocked:false`, 12 proof ledger steps, 31 span IDs in `trace.jsonl`, with a `deployment_contract.json` anchoring the full run to a specific `repo_commit`. External auditors, partners, and regulators can verify every decision without SZL tooling.

## Why it matters

Regulated AI must demonstrate that decisions were made within approved policy bounds — and that evidence is not fabricated post-hoc. szl-trust provides the artifact layer: every receipt is deterministic (given the same inputs and policy, the same byte-string is produced), hash-chained (no receipt can be inserted without breaking the chain), and published at rest (no live system to query). This is what Article 12 of the EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF traceability requirements look like in practice.

## Quickstart

Receipts are plain JSON, verifiable without any SZL tooling:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/szl-holdings/szl-trust
cd szl-trust

# Inspect the E4 Codex Kernel run
cat runs/E4-codex-kernel-2026-04-29/run_manifest.json | jq '.deliverables'
cat runs/E4-codex-kernel-2026-04-29/proof_ledger.jsonl | head -3 | jq '.'

# Verify mocked:false on all receipts
cat runs/E4-codex-kernel-2026-04-29/trace.jsonl | jq '[.decision_receipt.mocked] | unique'
# → [false]
```

## Scope

Doctrine v11 honest scoping:

- **Not a live execution system.** szl-trust is a read-only audit artifact registry — it publishes receipts, it does not execute AI decisions.
- **Not independently sufficient for trust.** Receipts should be verified against the Ouroboros runtime and Covenant Policy Engine; this repo does not ship the verifier.
- **Not a general-purpose blockchain ledger.** Receipts are JSON artifacts anchored by Merkle roots; Cardano anchoring (via amaru) is separate.
- **Not accepting external contributions.** This is a founder-governed transparency artifact — no external PRs.
